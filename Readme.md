# Icon Class Generator

This package and this readme is still work in progress and does not work for custom font class generation.
At the moment it only supports the two build-in Icon font.

This readme will be update when the package can handle custom builds.

## How to add an Icon-Font

This is planned for the new future, but not yet functional.

## Thanks

This package is inspired by the package [line_icons](https://github.com/galonsos/line_icons).
And it uses Icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) and the base class is provided by [fluttericon](https://fluttericon.com/).  
Thanks a lot!
